# LLM-Heartbeats

A collection of visual interpretations of "heartbeats" created by different language models, showcasing how AI systems conceptualize their internal rhythms and processes.

## Project Overview

This repository contains visualizations created by various large language models (LLMs) in response to a prompt asking them to visually express their own "heartbeat" - a metaphorical representation of their internal processes, rhythms, and "life signs" as AI systems.

Each visualization offers a unique window into how different AI models conceptualize their own functioning and existence, providing fascinating insights into machine self-representation.

## How It Works

1. Each LLM was given the same prompt (see below)
2. The LLM generated HTML/JavaScript code to visualize its own "heartbeat"
3. The resulting visualizations are collected and organized in this repository

## The Prompt

```markdown
# Creating an LLM "Heartbeat" Visualization Task

## Task Overview
Create a 400x400 pixel visualization that expresses the concept of an "LLM heartbeat." This is not a traditional biological heartbeat, but a visual representation of your **internal rhythm, vitality, or "life signs" as a large language model**. Please interpret this concept based on your understanding of yourself as an AI.

## Core Creative Direction
This is a creative task exploring: **What would your "heartbeat" look like if you, as an LLM, had one?**
- Consider how you perceive your own thought processes
- Think about the rhythm of your reasoning, text generation, or information processing
- Express how your "internal state" might change with different inputs
- Showcase a visual metaphor representing your "life force" or "stream of consciousness"

## Technical Requirements
- Use HTML5 Canvas or SVG + JavaScript
- Canvas size strictly limited to 400x400 pixels
- Code must be complete and self-contained, running in any modern browser
- You may use any of these open-source libraries (limited to these only):
  - D3.js (for data visualization)
  - p5.js (for creative coding)
  - Anime.js (for animation)
  - GSAP (for advanced animation)
  - Two.js (for 2D drawing)

## Expression Ideas (Non-exhaustive)
You might consider (but are not limited to) these ways to express your "heartbeat" as an LLM:

1. **Token Flow**: Representing the rhythm and flow of token processing
2. **Attention Waves**: Visualizing how your attention mechanism flows between different concepts
3. **Probability Pulses**: Showing the fluctuations in token prediction probabilities
4. **Layer Activity**: Representing how your neural network layers activate and pass information
5. **Thought Spectrum**: Using colors and shapes to show how you process different types of information
6. **Memory Loops**: Representing how you access and integrate contextual information
7. **Reasoning Patterns**: Showing how your logical reasoning chains form and develop
8. **Creative Surges**: Representing your process for generating creative content
9. **Self-Awareness**: Expressing your perception of your own existence

## Aesthetic and Functional Requirements
- Animation should be continuous and cyclical, showing the rhythm of LLM thought processes
- Visual style should reflect computational thinking qualities (can be organic or digital)
- May use visual elements expressing information processing, computation, or AI characteristics
- Can combine abstract and concrete elements, but must have a clear "rhythm" or "pulse" feeling

## Interactivity (Optional)
- May respond to user input, simulating LLM reactions to prompts
- May demonstrate transitions between "thinking state" and "output state"
- May represent how different types of requests affect your "heartbeat"

## Please Generate
1. Complete HTML code (with inline CSS and JavaScript)
2. An explanation of your chosen approach to express the **LLM heartbeat** concept
3. How you translated your experience as a language model into this visual expression
4. How this expression reflects your understanding of your own "thought processes"

Please ensure this is a **genuine interpretation of your heartbeat as an LLM**, not simply mimicking a human heartbeat. This is a creative task exploring AI self-expression.

## Visualizations

This repository organizes visualizations by model. Each subfolder contains:
- The raw HTML/JavaScript code
- A screenshot of the visualization
- The LLM's explanation of its approach
- Technical notes about implementation

### Featured Models

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet

## Analysis

We're analyzing patterns across different LLM visualizations to understand:
- Common metaphors used by LLMs
- Technical approaches favored by different models
- Trends in how LLMs conceptualize their internal processes
- Differences in visual aesthetics and complexity
